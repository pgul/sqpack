Serguei Revtov (sir@cb.tver.ru):

  There're still problems with lastreads in sqpack with Jam bases. I've
tryed to fix that but seems didn't :(

Lodewijk Otto:

 When the partition where the messagebases are situated runs full,
sqpack still goos on purging messages, and in this process copies only
part of large message-bases, and does not keep the old one, when it
runs out of disk-space. I have twice lost an important number of
messages now this way.

Max Levenkov:

 Core dumps on JAM bases (sometimes).
