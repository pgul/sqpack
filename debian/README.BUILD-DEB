Hi

If you want to build a .deb-Package of this source for yourself you need some
tools. I suggest you install task-debian-devel, i think it depends on all
neccessary tools. (I think you already have gcc installed :) )

For some Husky-Packages you also need texi2html, so install it :)

For more information on package-building install the maint-guide and
packaging-manual.


If you have problems mail me at joerg@goliathbbs.dnsalias.net or write in
the echo FIDOSOFT.HUSKY !

bye
Joerg
