0. the smapi and the fidoconfig package is required for sqPack.

1. Put sqPack in the directory where the other packages of fido
   linux reside:

   /usr/src/packages/        -> smapi/
                             -> fidoconfig/

You're ready. If you have a working fidoconfig, you can now purge MsgBases under
unix.
